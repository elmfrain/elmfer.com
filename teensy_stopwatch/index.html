                <p>
                    The Teensy Stopwatch is a DIY device that uses the Teensy 4.0 micro-controller for displaying and running a 
                    little stopwatch app onto an TFT LCD module, if as if it were a smartphone. 
                </p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>

                <p>
                    Since the Teensy 4.0 micro-controller has a powerful ARM Cortex processor with 1 MB of ram, it is totally feasible 
                    to create a responsive user interface with it.
                </p>

                <div style="height: 2.25in;">
                    <img alt="Teensy Board" src="teensy_board.jpg" class="img_content">
                </div>

                <p>
                    It has enough memory to store a 320x240 colored image, and this allows the application to buffer the user interface 
                    into it for faster performance as opposed to writing to the LCD module for every draw command which can be slow. 
                    In order to send this image data to the LCD to display, it uses the SPI interface. The Teensy micro-controller 
                    has a hardware accelerated implementation of SPI, therefore, this allows an asynchronous transfer of data to 
                    the screen without occupying the processor's computational power.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Nonetheless, implementing an efficient driver for the module is an intimidating task, for the module and SPI interface 
                    has many technicalities to be aware of in order to use them efficiently. Fortunately, <strong>vindar</strong> from GitHub as already 
                    developed a sophisticated driver that does all the heavy lifting for us. The only things we need to do is to allocate 
                    memory for our frame-buffers (images that it is going to display) and to command an update to the driver whenever our 
                    image is ready for display. This driver has dramatically simplified the development process for this project.

                <p>
                    For this project, I've decided to create my own UI code, but user interfacing is not easy, especially if you have to code 
                    its functionality from scratch. However, from what I learned from modding Minecraft, it can be simplified enough in order 
                    to not practically reinvent the wheel. What I did is create a module called <code>UIrender</code> that has a list of drawing commands 
                    that can be executed in the application in order to draw interfaces. The most important commands are, <code>drawQuad</code>, 
                    <code>drawGradientQuad</code>, <code>drawString</code>, and <code>clear</code>.
                </p>

                <div>
                    <h4 style="text-align: center;">UIrender Module Commands</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>drawQuad</code> draws a quad by specifying its boundaries (left, top, right, and bottom) and its color.</li>
                        <li><code>drawGradientQuad</code> similar to last, but specified with two colors to create a gradient.</li>
                        <li><code>drawString</code> draws text by specifying the text to display, its position, size, and color. </li>
                        <li><code>clear</code> clears everything with a specified color; it is used for creating a background.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h4>Text Rendering</h4>

                <p>
                    <code>drawString</code> is complicated because it uses many 
                    textured quads to display text, but how does it exactly work? For this, I give credit to a YouTuber named 
                    <strong>ThinMatrix</strong>, for he showed a method on how to display text for games without using a game engine.
                </p>

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    We need is an atlas (image texture) of all the glyphs of a font and a list containing positions, offsets, and boundaries 
                    for all the corresponding glyphs.
                </p>

                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img id="img_content" alt="Font Atlas Example" src="font_atlas_example.jpg" style="height: 3in; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">
                    <img id="img_content" alt="Glyph Info Example" src="glyph_info_example.jpg" style="height: 3in; max-width: 100%; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">
                </div>

                <p>
                    All this data can be extracted from a font by using a program called <strong>Hiero</strong>, and 
                    the data is then converted into a <code>C array</code> using <strong>Python</strong> so that is can be stored within the source code.
                </p>

                <div style="height: 4in;">
                    <img alt="Font Atlas To C Array" src="font_atlas_to_c_array.jpg" class="img_content">
                </div>

                <p>
                    With all this 
                    font data, we can now display glyphs. The first thing the module will do is to split every character in the 
                    string (of text) into a list of characters. For each character, it then searches from the list extracted from Hiero 
                    for its width, height, offsets, and its location on the atlas. Each character will then have a quad drawn with its 
                    glyph texture extracted from the atlas, and then the module will move its cursor by the width of the character drawn. 
                    This is done to all elements in the list which results into having text drawn.
                </p>

                <h4>User Input</h4>

                <p>
                    Now we have a way to display a user interface, but the program needs to be able to respond to inputs. The Teensy 
                    Stopwatch has a rotary encoder that sends a signal when its knob is rotated or when its switch is pressed, yet due to it's 
                    “bouncing” tendencies, I used a Debouncer to remove any signal abnormalities in software for input reliability.
                </p>

                <div style="height: 2.5in;">
                    <img alt="Rotary Encoder Module" src="rotary_encoder_module.jpg" class="img_content">
                </div>

                <p>
                    I created a 
                    module called <code>Input</code> that polls for input changes every frame. With this module, you can add <code>listeners</code> (code that executes 
                    from an event), so when the user, for example, presses the switch, the module will execute all the <code>listener</code>s' code that responds 
                    to a switch press. This event driven system allows you to be able to interact with UI elements, and it simplifies user interactivity 
                    as opposed to listening signals manually.
                </p>

                    <img alt="Input Listener Example" src="input_listener_example.jpg" class="img_content">
                </div>

                <p>
                    At last with the modules <code>UIrender</code> and <code>Input</code> written, we can code basic “screens” that the user can use. A <code>screen</code> element should 
                    be able to respond to input, draw a user interface, and handle any internal logic (e.g. change screen when switch is pressed).

                <h2>How To Use</h2>

                <p>
                    There are three screens for this project, <code>Select Screen</code>, <code>Stopwatch</code>, and <code>Timer</code>. On upon startup, the user is met 
                    with the <code>Select Screen</code> screen. The user can choose to use either the stopwatch or the timer functionality.
                </p>

                <h4>Stopwatch Screen</h4>

                <img alt="Stopwatch Couting" src="stopwatch_counting.jpg" id="img_content" style="height: 2.25in; margin-left: .125in; margin-right: .5in; float: left; clear: both;">
                <p>
                    Using the Stopwatch screen, the user can start the clock by pressing <code>Resume</code> and stop it by pressing either <code>Pause</code> or <code>Reset</code>. 
                </p>
                <div style="clear: both;"></div>

                <p></p>

                <img alt="Stopwatch Lap" src="stopwatch_lap.jpg" id="img_content" style="height: 2.25in; margin-left: .125in; margin-right: .5in; float: left; clear: both;">
                <p>
                    While the clock is running, the user can press the <code>Lap</code> button to record the exact time it was pressed.
                </p>
                <div style="clear: both;"></div>

                <p></p>

                <p>
                    Upon stopping the clock, the user can then press the <code>View Laps</code> button; this will allow the user to scroll through all of the 
                    laps recording showing their time and duration by turning the rotary encoder.
                </p>
                <div style="clear: both;"></div>

                <p>
                    Lastly, the user can press the <code>Reset</code> button 
                    to reset the clock back to zero, and it will also clear the list of laps recorded.
                </p>
                <div style="clear: both;"></div>

                <p>
                    Using the Timer, the user can set a duration to which the clock will count down from. The user can press 
                    the <code>Set</code> button to show a menu to set the timer. In this menu, the user can select <code>10m</code>, <code>1m</code>, <code>15s</code>, <code>1s</code>, 
                    and <code>Done</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The user selects the option and then uses the rotary encoder clockwise or counterclockwise to increment or 
                    decrement the timer respectively. When done, the user can use another option or press <code>Done</code> to set the timer.
                </p>
                <div style="clear: both;"></div>

                <p>
                    When the clock 
                    is started by pressing <code>Resume</code>, it will count down until either it is paused or when the clock reaches zero. When the clock reaches zero, 
                    it will trigger the buzzer on and off every half second until the user presses <code>Stop</code> to which the clock resets to the set duration.
                </p>
                <div style="clear: both;"></div>

                <h4>Screen Selection</h4>

                <p>
                    In order to change the functionality while in the <code>Stopwatch</code>, or <code>Timer</code> screen, the user must hold the switch for three seconds until 
                    the <code>Select Screen</code> screen appears. The user may then select and change the functionality of the stopwatch.

                <h2>Project Construction</h2>

                <p>
                    During the development of this project, all the hardware was connected using a breadboard and jumper wires.
                </p>

                <div style="height: 0.5in;">
                    <img alt="Project Breadboard" src="project_breadboard.jpg" class="img_content">
                </div>

                <p>
                    For the LCD module, I need to be aware that it can perform erratically if their wires connecting to the micro-controller 
                    is long. This is a result from induction formed when current passes through a wire; induction can reverberate the signal 
                    because the current cannot be switched on and off reliably at speeds of 30 megahertz (the speed which the module communicates 
                    with the micro-controller). This problem is mitigated by using short wires and by decreasing the speed in which the module is communicating 
                    at. Additionally, the LED pin of the module is connected to 5V using a 220 ohm resistor.
                </p>

                <div style="height: 3in;">
                    <img alt="LCD Module Breadboard" src="lcd_module_breadboard.jpg" class="img_content">
                </div>

                <p>
                    The rest of the components are also connected  to one of the Teensy's pins. For example, the rotary encoder has the A, B, 
                    and C pins connected to the micro-controller. Furthermore, since the rotary encoder is just a module with three switches 
                    (they can only open or close a circuit, not send 0v or 3.3v), each input needs to be pulled up to 3.3v with a 1k ohm resistor in 
                    order for their inputs to be readable to the micro-controller. For the buzzer, the positive pin is connected directly 
                    to the micro-controller.
                </p>

                    I initially tried to put this project on a perfboard, but unfortunately, it was a mess since making all the necessary connections 
                    on a tiny space manually made the circuits unreliable. I instead decided to design a custom PCB for this project because 
                    I could then add a Li-Ion battery to power this project in a compact package. I learned how to use a prototyping program called 
                    <strong>EasyEDA</strong> to design the PCB for this project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, I needed to create a schematic of the project by following what 
                    I did on the breadboard. However, I did not know how to create a circuit for the battery. Fortunately, I found a YouTuber by the 
                    name of <strong>GreatScott</strong> who has a video showing on how to create a battery circuit. It was a standalone circuit 
                    originally meant to be used as separate PCB module, but it was easy to implement it with the rest of the project.

                </ul>

                <p>
                    When this 
                    schematic was finished, I can then import it into a PCB editor within EasyEDA to layout all the components and connect all the circuitry. 
                    I additionally created a logo for the project onto which it is printed on the back of the PCB because it looks so cool! 
                </p>

                <div style="text-align: center;">

                </div>

                <p>
                    Once I finished designing the PCB, I sent the design to a PCB manufacturer <strong>JLCPCB</strong>. They where able to 
                    manufacture it in within a week, and it was shipped to my house in about 2 weeks. Lastly, I made a spreadsheet called a BOM containing 
                    all the components that I am going to install onto the PCB; this was used to order all the materials needed by this project.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Assembling the project was a little daunting because I needed to solder small surface mount components (like resistors) which 
                    can be tricky. Nonetheless, by using some solder flux aided with the soldering process, and, along with the BOM, I successfully assembled the project.
                    What a thriller!

                <h2>Its Purpose</h2>

                <p>
                    I have been fascinated on how our computers work after I learned some programming, so naturally, I got curious on how the hardware 
                    worked. I discovered Arduino, which is a micro-controller programming environment and a manufacturer of some micro-controller 
                    boards such as the Arduino UNO. Once I got a hold of an Arduino kit, and, after tinkering around with it, this gave me an idea! 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I knew I had to try to attempt making a basic app using an embedded system which led me to this project. This journey has taught 
                    me so much because I had to understand how electronics work, how to design PCB's, how to assemble them, and also knowing the 
                    limitations of an embedded system (such as limited RAM or computational power). Additionally, since the Arduino programming 
                    environment uses a C like language, that has also taught me on how to be a better programmer by teaching me exactly what goes 
                    on behind the scenes such as memory management, compilers, and preprocessing.
